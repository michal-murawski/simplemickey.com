## Defining Refactoring

* **refactoring (noun)**  - a change made to the structure of software to make it easier to understand and easier/cheaper to modify WITHOUT changing its observable behavior.
* **refactoring** **(verb)** - to restructure software with a series of refactorings WITHOUT changing its observable behavior.

  Each refactoring should be small itself or a combination of small steps. During refactoring our code should not spend much time in a broken state.

TBC... :D
